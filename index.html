          Burens is a 23 year old kenyan with a high affinity for technology. Being a software Developer has been my child hood
          dream despite the hiccups experienced in the quest to achieve this feat. Moreover, I commenced my academic journey at
          Bethel primary (Homabay) before proceeding to St. Peter’s Cape View,Homabay. Consequently, I proceeded to St. Mary’s
          School,Yala for my post primary education. Well, it was at this institution that I developed a great thirst for
          technology alongside finding an academic and tech mentor(Collins Reuben, currently a Full stack developer). My mentor aided
          in transforming my child hood dream into a reality. I proceeded to join Chuka University where I pursued a Bsc. in Computer Science
          and graduated in 2020. In a bid to develop my skills and a partial fulfillment of my Degree, I was attached at the Milimani
          Law Courts for a period between 09/May/2019 to 19/August/2019. Moreover, I sharpened my skills and gained skills in relation to
          computer hardware and software. Considering my unending thirst for technology knowledge, I joined Moringa School on 02,
          February,2021 a community am happy to be a part of.

      <h2>Why Programming?</h2>
      <p style="text-align: center;">
        “Technology has always been my second nature, a computer is to me just
        like a stethoscope is to a doctor. Therefore, I upgraded my focal point
        of view from the mechanism behind the operation of a machine “computer 
        hardware” to writing the instructions “coding”. Furthermore the fact 
        that I had acquired prior knowledge in programming did not deter me from 
        joining Moringa as I am in Moringa to transition from the developer I am
        into a world class full-stack developer.Considering the thrill that 
        accompanies tools used in development i.e Git, programming is a <strong>tried</strong> 
        and <em>true</em> for me”<br>
