          Having worked on multiple projects, I believe I am a proficient developer. Being a software developer has been a dream
          come true and is a dream that I have achieved with a lot of hard work and prayer. Although an up-hill task I believe I
          can do it since am still a work in progress. Furthermore, I aim towards being a skilled full stack developer in the next
          couple months. As i have exquisite skills in the following languages.

          During my attachment program at the Milimani Law Courts, I acquired a very vital skill which was computer hardware
          maintenance. As a result I am currently capable of carrying out hardware maintenance for most of the computers in the
          market, generation and brand notwithstanding. Navigating through a computer motherboard requires and understanding of
          the functionality of a computer which I understand well. Therefore, I believe I am competent in handling computer
          hardware.

          As a blockchain enthusiast, I developed a blockchain depiction of the sugar supply chain for my final year project at
          Chuka University. Blockchain is still a young and unstable though fascinating and debatably the next big thing in tech.
          Although not a certified blockchain developer, I have the ability to develop and operate a basic blockchain network.

          I realised my prowess in logo designing in December, 2020 when I created my first logos. I developed the Weekendie Tours
          and Travels logo as my first professional logo. Despite being a newbie in graphics and design, I believe I can polish my
          skills into a great designer.
