        As a go-getter, I have worked on a number of projects both individual and group projects. Some complete while others not
        complete. Currently being well conversant with HTML and CSS and partially Javascript, most of my ongoing or complete
        projects are in line with the stated languages. However, as I advance into more powerful programming languages, my
        future projects <em>(not far from now)</em> will be developed with a variety of languages. For instance, most of my projects will potray the
        prowess of a competent Full stack developer in the next couple months. Consequently, I have showcased a few of my
        projects below. But not to forget, it’s all God otherwise without him I wouldn’t have reached this far.

      <h3>Hawaii Project</h3>
      <div class="p2">
        <p>
          In a quest to accomplish an assignment on my favourite vacation spot, there was no better candidate than the Hawaii
          Islands. The project talks on the history of Hawaii and Hawaii’s current beautiful beaches. However not complete, the
          project is a bombshell especially for the adventure oriented. Moreover, the Hawaii Islands project spans over the
          initial inhabitants of Hawaii to it currently being a United States of America’s state. Hawaii Islands project is
          developed with a cocktail of <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> only but with a pledge to expand it in the near future. Considering,
          my interest in learning javascript so soon, i will definitely incorporate javascriptfunctions into this project upon
          learning.<br>

      <div class="p2">
        <p>
          Being a fitness enthusiast, I decided to work on a gym project namely Pro-fitness. Its aim was to relay information on a
          variety of training techniques ranging from heavy-weight lifting to lean muscle therapy, the project was also to provide
          information on the type of diet to adhere to depending on your workout plan. Although none of the objectives has been
          achieved being a work in progress but will be complete and live soon enough. Developing this project required the
          application of <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> languages, but will adopt the javascript functions in due time. So for fitness fanatics, I
          got your backs on this one.

    <h3>First Portfolio</h3>
    <div class="p3">
      <p>
        As a human, I definitely made an attempt at developing a portfolio before this final project, and this what I got to
        show for it. This is the output of my first effort towards making a professional portfolio. The project holds little
        information about me and is not complete. It has been developed using basic HTML and CSS.

    <div class="p2">
      <p>
        As a training exercise I built the Moringa Resort Website to aid in sharpening my skills. The website is incomplete but
        as indicated in the navigation bar should hold all that information. The project is to be complete in the upcoming week with
        an additional dynamic touch when javascript will be introduced to its code. Therefore, currently it has been developed
        with <em>HTML</em> and <em>CSS</em>.
